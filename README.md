# xyzequalizer
A 3d sound equalizer, exploring perlin noise applied to spherical coordinates with the help of webaudio API. White particles are shaped by the waveform of the sound (or the Fast Fourier Transform), while the red particles are shaped by the frequencies.

The spherical coordinate system is based on the Spherical Coordinate tutorial by Daniel Shiffman.
